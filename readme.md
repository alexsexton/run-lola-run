# Run Lola Run

A basic Gulp 4 starting point.

## Dependencies

Latest versions of node and npm then run:

`npm install -g gulp-cli` to install gulp-cli globally.

## Installation

Clone this repo, change the repo and package name then drop into the templates directory of your favourite CMS.

Then run: `npm install`

Happy coding

## Assumptions

Do you work in the `assets` folder which contains `images`, `js` and `scss`.

The task then builds to the `static` folder.

Change this to suit your development style.

Don't blame me if it doesn't work.

Peace
