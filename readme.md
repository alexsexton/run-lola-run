# Run Lola Run

A basic Gulp 4 starting point.

## Dependencies

You'll need the latest stable versions of node and npm then run:

`npm install -g gulp-cli` If you don't have gulp-cli installed globally.

## Installation

Clone this repo, change the repo and package name then drop into the templates directory of your favourite CMS.

Then run: `npm install`

## Using this

Do your work in the `assets` folder which contains separate `images`, `js` and `scss` folders

The task then builds to the `static` folder. Obviously you can change this to suit your development style and/or platform.

To add new packages from the command line like type `npm install jquery --save` to install jquery for example. This creates a dependency in the `package.json` file.

Don't blame me if it doesn't work.

Happy coding. Peace
