# Run Lola Run

This is WIP of my new dev environment. Switching from Grunt/Bower to Gulp and Yarn if I can work the later out.

## Dependencies

Latest versions of node and npm

`npm install -g gulp-cli`

## Installation

Clone this, change the repo and package name then drop into the templates directory of Craft / Shopify (for example). Then run: `npm install`.

## Assumptions

You're file tree has a `src` folder containing `images`, `js` and `scss` which is where you do your work

The tasks builds to an `assets` folder (in this instance it's because it's for a Shopify build) and every things goes into a single level folder. No sub folders.

Change this to suit your development style.
